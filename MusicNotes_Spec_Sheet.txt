# Music Notation Game Spec Sheet

## Overview
This spec sheet outlines the functional requirements, feature list, and data-model sketch for a comprehensive music notation game titled **NotaQuest**. NotaQuest is designed as an engaging, gamified platform for learning, practicing, composing, and exploring music notation. It integrates elements of education, creativity, and interactivity, drawing from public-domain music libraries for content.

The game emphasizes a **colorful visual design** to enhance user engagement:
- **Vibrant color palette**: Use bright, harmonious colors inspired by music (e.g., blues and greens for calm learning modes, reds and oranges for challenging gameplay, purples for creative composition). Backgrounds feature subtle musical motifs like swirling notes or staves in pastel shades.
- **Themed UI elements**: Buttons, icons, and progress bars use gradient fills (e.g., a rainbow spectrum for note recognition). Animations include colorful particle effects for correct answers (e.g., exploding stars in gold/yellow) and gentle fades for hints.
- **Accessibility in color**: High-contrast modes for color-blind users, with options to customize schemes.

The game is geared towards **three experience groups**:
- **Beginner**: Focus on basics with simplified interfaces, guided tutorials, and forgiving mechanics (e.g., unlimited hints, slower pacing).
- **Intermediate**: Builds on fundamentals with moderate challenges, introducing complexity and requiring some independence.
- **Advanced**: Deep dives into sophisticated notation, composition, and analysis, with competitive elements and minimal hand-holding.

The game supports cross-platform play (web, mobile, desktop) and uses standard formats like MusicXML for interoperability.

## Functional Requirements
### Core Functionality
