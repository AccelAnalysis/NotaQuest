Below is a clean, structured set of **next-step prompts you can paste directly into Windsurf (SWE-1)** to continue building the **MVP of the music-notation game, NotaQuest**, based on typical component scaffolding already generated.

These prompts assume:

* The project folder is already scaffolded with `/src`, `/components`, `/pages`, `/types`, `/utils`, `/assets/music/`, etc.
* You want the MVP playable, with basic UI, fundamental game loop, and initial notation-reading challenges.

I’ve broken the prompts into **sequenced steps**, each starting with the required **checkmark prefix (✅)** per your preference.

# ⭐ **NEXT-STEP PROMPTS FOR WINDSURF (SWE-1)**

Paste **one step at a time** into Windsurf while building.

---

## ✅ Prompt for Windsurf (SWE-1): *Step 1 — Establish MVP Requirements Inside the Codebase*

**Goal:** Create a clear living requirements file inside the repo and prepare SWE-1’s context.

```
You are SWE-1. Create a new file at `/docs/MVP_REQUIREMENTS.md` that contains:

1. NotaQuest MVP Goals:
   - A single-screen game loop
   - Display staff notation (treble clef) with randomized notes (A–G)
   - Playable session of 10 rounds
   - Player selects the correct note name (A–G)
   - Scoring + accuracy tracking
   - Basic animations for correct/incorrect
   - Mobile-friendly UI
   - Data sourcing from local JSON notation library

2. Components needed:
   - StaffDisplay
   - NoteRenderer
   - AnswerButtons
   - ScorePanel
   - GameController (logic)
   - AudioPlayer (optional placeholder)
   - utils: randomNote(), noteToPosition()

3. Pages:
   - `/pages/index.tsx` (home)
   - `/pages/play.tsx` (game)
   - `/pages/results.tsx` (results)

Write this document cleanly and commit it. Do not implement code yet.
```

---

## ✅ Prompt for Windsurf (SWE-1): *Step 2 — Implement the core data model*

**Goal:** Create the note model + notation library used by the MVP.

```
Add a new file `/src/types/music.ts` with:

export type NoteLetter = 'A'|'B'|'C'|'D'|'E'|'F'|'G';

export interface NotationItem {
  id: string;
  letter: NoteLetter;
  midi: number;
  staffPosition: number;
}

Also create `/src/data/notation-basic.json` with 7 entries (A–G) including id, midi, staffPosition.

Do not build the UI yet.
```

---

## ✅ Prompt for Windsurf (SWE-1): *Step 3 — Create utility functions for note logic*

**Goal:** Implement the MVP utilities required by the game loop.

```
Create `/src/utils/music.ts` with:

- getRandomNote(): returns a NotationItem.
- noteToPosition(): converts staffPosition to Y-offset or other coordinate usable by the renderer.
- shuffle<T>()
- range()

Write strong TypeScript typings. No UI work yet.
```

---

## ✅ Prompt for Windsurf (SWE-1): *Step 4 — Build the StaffDisplay and NoteRenderer components*

**Goal:** Render a staff + a note in correct position.

```
Create two components:

1. `/src/components/StaffDisplay.tsx`
   - Renders 5 staff lines (SVG or divs)
   - Accepts: currentNote: NotationItem | null

2. `/src/components/NoteRenderer.tsx`
   - Renders a single note head at proper vertical position
   - Receives: staffPosition number
   - Integrates with StaffDisplay via children

Use Tailwind for styling, make mobile-friendly. No animations yet.
```

---

## ✅ Prompt for Windsurf (SWE-1): *Step 5 — Add AnswerButtons component*

**Goal:** Add A–G answer buttons with click handlers.

```
Create `/src/components/AnswerButtons.tsx`:

Props:
- onSelect: (note: NoteLetter) => void
- disabled?: boolean

Render 7 rounded buttons (A–G).
Make them responsive.
```

---

## ✅ Prompt for Windsurf (SWE-1): *Step 6 — Implement GameController logic*

**Goal:** Core of the MVP game loop.

```
Create `/src/controllers/GameController.ts`:

State:
- currentRound (1–10)
- currentNote: NotationItem
- score: number
- status: 'idle'|'awaiting'|'correct'|'incorrect'|'finished'

Actions:
- startGame()
- nextRound()
- submitAnswer(noteLetter)
- reset()

Export an instance or class (your choice).
```

---

## ✅ Prompt for Windsurf (SWE-1): *Step 7 — Build `/pages/play.tsx`*

**Goal:** Assemble game screen.

```
Build `/pages/play.tsx`:

- Import GameController, StaffDisplay, AnswerButtons.
- On load: GameController.startGame()
- Show:
   - StaffDisplay (with currentNote)
   - AnswerButtons
   - Score + Round counter
- On answer: call submitAnswer()
- If correct: temporarily flash green animation on note
- If incorrect: flash red animation
- After flash: GameController.nextRound()
- When finished redirect to `/pages/results.tsx`

Keep it minimal for MVP.
```

---

## ✅ Prompt for Windsurf (SWE-1): *Step 8 — Build Results Screen*

```
Create `/pages/results.tsx` that displays:

- score
- accuracy %
- "Play Again" button -> /pages/play
- "Home" button -> /

Pull score & totals via GameController or query params.
```

---

## ✅ Prompt for Windsurf (SWE-1): *Step 9 — Add basic animations*

```
Add lightweight feedback animations:

- animate-correct (green pulse)
- animate-wrong (red shake)
- fade-in for notes

Create `/src/styles/animations.css` and import globally.
Use Tailwind keyframe utilities or custom CSS.
```

---

## ✅ Prompt for Windsurf (SWE-1): *Step 10 — Add basic sound engine (optional MVP upgrade)*

```
Create `/src/utils/audio.ts` with:

- playCorrect()
- playWrong()
- playNote(midi: number)

Use WebAudio (no libraries). Provide safe fallback for iOS Safari.
Integrate in play.tsx after correct/incorrect answers.
```
